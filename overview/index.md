## Overview

- HTML consists of a series of elements and attributes which are used to mark up all the components of a document to structure it in a meaningful way.
- Elements are named for a meaningful use.
- Confusion: In `<html>` html is a tag and whole along with the content inside opening and closing tags is considered as element.
- Some closing tags are omissible.
- Replaced elements: For example, an image tag `<img>`, it is replaced by and referenced image.
- Non-replaced elements: Like header elements, that gives the output what we commanded.
- Void elements: These elements can work without a closing tag, for example an input tag, sometimes we call it self-closing tags.
- Attributes are like extra controls to an element.
- Boolean required attributes doesn't necessarily need value.
- HTML is not case sensitive.
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the structure and content of the HTML document. Browsers make objects for each elements and texts. These objects are called nodes and text nodes, respectively.
